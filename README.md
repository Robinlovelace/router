The goal of router is to provide a simple way to calculate routes on
transport networks. In the same way that {mlr3} and {parsnip} provide
unified interfaces to modelling packages, {router} provides a unified
interface to many routing packages.

It was split out from the {stplanr} package.

## Installation

You can install the development version of router from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Robinlovelace/router")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(router)
## basic example code
```
